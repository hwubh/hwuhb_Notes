- Data-driven Character Animation
  - Motion Capture (Mocap): Digitally recording movements
    - Types: 
      - Rotoscoping
      - Mechanical Mocap: Exoskeleton
      - Inertial Mocap: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU); Accelerometers (3dof) + axis gyroscope (3dof)
      - Optical Mocap: Reflective/light-emitting markers; Multi-view geometry;Solve body motions based on marker positions
      - Markerless Mocap: put camera in different views.
      - Motion Estimation: Monocular / stereo(Sparse Sensor?)
  - Motion Synthesis:
    - Motion retargeting: Retarget a motion to a character with diff bones/ bone names/ reference pose/ bone ratios/ skeletal structure
    - Motion transition
    - Motion graph
